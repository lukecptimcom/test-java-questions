# test-java-questions

This is an interview exercise, and is intended to be a starting point for discussions in an interview situation.

It is *not* an example of our general production code! :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The primary piece of code to review is org.test.testytest.service.MyLovelyServiceImpl

This piece of code is an exercise to test your understanding of the code.

The task is as follows:
 
1. Please describe the purpose of this code.
(Including any spring specific functionality and annotations that are used in the code).
 
2. Please highlight any areas where you feel that this code should be refactored, or improved to fit with SpringBoot standards.
 
3. Please highlight any other general areas where you feel as if it could be made more readable.
 
4. (General) Are there any features of Java8 that might be useful here in order to cut down the extra pieces of code?
